# Data Structures and Algorithms practice

## Description

This is my implementation of certain data structures and solutions to algorithm questions. I often update this repo with new challenges I've solved. I've included tests for some of the data structures and plan to include more.

## Runing the repo

If you want to run the repo yourself, follow these steps

1. run `npm install` to install all required packages
2. run `npm run test` to test the functions
